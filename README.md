Title

Middle-earth: Shadow of War 

Plot
Shadow of War continues the previous game's narrative, which is based on J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium and set between the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Like its predecessor, the game also takes heavy inspiration from director Peter Jackson's The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings film adaptations. The player continues the story of the ranger Talion and the spirit of the elf lord Celebrimbor, who shares Talion's body, as they forge a new Ring of Power to amass an army to fight against Sauron. The game builds upon the "Nemesis System" introduced in Shadow of Mordor, allowing Talion to gain followers from several races of Middle-earth, including Uruks and Ologs, and plan out complex strategies using these to complete missions.

Designer – Monolith Productions
Monolith Productions is an American video game developer based in Kirkland, Washington. The company was founded in October 1994 by Brian Goble, Bryan Bouwman, Garrett Price, Paul Renault, Toby Gladwell, Brian Waite, and Jace Hall. The company is known for their games Blood, the No One Lives Forever and F.E.A.R series. Monolith is also known for the development of the graphical game engine LithTech, which has been used for most of their games and premiered with Shogo: Mobile Armor Division in September 1998; they also used Brian Goble's Windows Animation Package 32 engine for their 2D games. Between 1997 and 1999, Monolith also published games – some developed by the studio, some by third parties. In 2004, Monolith Productions was acquired by Warner Bros. In 2014, they released Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, the game was heavily praised. Following after that with a sequel, Middle-earth: Shadow of War released in 2017, also critically praised.

Final Thoughts
Similar to the way Batman: Arkham City built on the foundation of Arkham Asylum, Middle-earth: Shadow of War is bigger and more ambitious in scope than Shadow of Mordor, with great results. The way it expands the Nemesis system with far greater variety and fortress sieges makes even better use of the stand-out generated characters, and its battles with memorable uruk captains remain challenging all the way through the campaign and into the clever asynchronous multiplayer beyond.

Aspects that should have been tested
1.	Visual inconsistency
The thing that stands out to me is Talions and other characters hair. In certain lighting, such as out in the daylight, it is entirely one color and extremely washed out looking. While it looks a lot better in darker areas (as in actual hair), it still doesn't seem right. That goes for other characters hair as well. This is a rather picky thing but it stands out like a sore thumb to me and his hair was much better in the first game. Level of detail I feel is the main reason this game doesn't look good though, it's horrible.
2.	Microtransactions
Another questionable addition to Shadow of War is its online storefront, bringing microtransactions into yet another AAA title. Although the random loot drops only include Epic tier rewards instead of the paid currency's Legendaries, the difference in quality between the two, in practice, isn't substantially different. In addition, after finishing the game, even with buying a dozen or so 1,200 Miran loot crates over the course of my adventure, I was still left with over 70,000 Mirian in reserve. Like so many of the other game's systems, the storefront feels less predatory and more like a cluelessly unnecessary addition.
3.	Some padding for length
Shadow of Mordor was a 15-25 hour game. Shadow of War feels at least double that. When Shadow of War is at its best-you're flying across the battlefield freezing enemies, setting them on fire, and destroying whole armies with your Uruk crew-it's awesome. The problem is it doesn't quite sustain that satisfaction and momentum throughout the entire game.
